Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for [Project Purpose]
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for solving [describe the specific task, e.g., time-series forecasting, sentiment analysis, text generation, etc.]. RNNs are well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, as they capture temporal dependencies and patterns across time.
